This project demonstrates wireless communication between two ESP32 devices using the ESP-NOW protocol, which allows devices to communicate directly without the need for a Wi-Fi network. One ESP32 acts as the transmitter, sending commands, and the other as the receiver, which processes those commands to control hardware such as motors and servos.
