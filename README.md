This project utilizes ESP-NOW, a low-power, peer-to-peer communication protocol, to enable wireless communication between two ESP32 development boards. The transmitter ESP32 is connected to a servo motor and a push button, while the receiver ESP32 controls a DC motor via a motor driver and can receive commands to stop or start the motor. The servo motor is controlled by button presses on the transmitter, and the receiver responds to commands sent from the transmitter.

When the button on the transmitter ESP32 is pressed, a stop command is sent to the receiver, which then stops the motor. At the same time, the servo is triggered to rotate to 90Â° and a buzzer is activated for 5 seconds. If the button is released, an emergency stop command is sent to the receiver, stopping the motor immediately and returning the servo to its initial position. The receiver ESP32 is responsible for receiving these commands and controlling the motor accordingly. It also features manual motor stop functionality through a button on the receiver.

The system uses ESP-NOW to send simple messages between the devices, each containing a command that controls the motor state. The transmitter sends out the commands (such as stop or emergency stop) to the receiver, which listens for incoming data and performs the respective action. The motor control on the receiver is handled through PWM signals for speed control, and the direction is set using two motor driver pins. The transmitter ESP32 is connected to a button, servo, and buzzer, while the receiver ESP32 is connected to the motor driver, control buttons, and pin sensors for the communication.

The setup requires two ESP32 boards with appropriate motor control circuitry, along with basic Arduino IDE setup. After uploading the respective codes to each ESP32 board, pressing the button on the transmitter will send commands to the receiver to stop the motor and trigger the servo and buzzer, effectively demonstrating remote control capabilities via ESP-NOW.
